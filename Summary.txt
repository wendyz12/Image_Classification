Project Title 
Dog Breed Recognition


Project Category
Machine Learning - Image Classification


Project Description
Set up a local system (including frontend/backend) to recognize the breed of the dog (from the possible 133 dog breeds) in the image uploaded by users.
Developed our model using transfer learning on a pre-trained classifier model VGG16. We used Deep Learning for Java (deeplearning4j- DL4J) libraries to train our model. 
The frontend was developed using Java Swing Library wherein user can choose dog image of his choice and then the model predicts the dog's breed, 
and its image is displayed along with a short description from Wikipedia and the probability values of the top five candidate breeds for prediction. 


Team Members and their responsibilities
Qi(Wendy) Zhao:
1. Constructed the system backend with a pre-trained model by building the classes of Classifier, Trainer, ImgSetIterator and ModelUtils
2. Resolved the issue of huge model size by extracting and saving the last layer of Vgg16
3. Created test cases for Classifier and ModelUtils class
4. Optimized and validated methods across classes and organized GitHub repo




Yingnan(Elva) Zhu:
1. Designed and built sketch of user interface class 
2. Constructed the program by connecting backend(the model) and frontend classes
3. Built a web scraper to fetch dog information and image from Wikipedia based on prediction result
4. Created test cases for web scraper class
5. Build ImageHandler class
 


Nidhi Gupta:
1. Worked on the Classifier class on the backend and integrated the most probable breeds  to the front end (UserInterface) class.
Most probable breeds are based on probability calculations in the Classifier class. 
Completed the classifier class’s two test cases.
2. ImageHandler Class and completed its test cases.
3. Trainer Class with one test case.
4. ImgDataSetIterator Class with 3 test cases
5. Used Robot java library to create a test case for Swing UserInterface.
